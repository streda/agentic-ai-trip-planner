    "# AgentsVille Trip Planner - Project Assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you'll implement an AI system to help you plan a trip--to the wonderful city of AgentsVille!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your AI system will demonstrate advanced LLM reasoning techniques including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Role-Based Prompting** - Your agent will act as a specialized travel planner\n",
    "2. **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning** - Step-by-step planning of itineraries\n",
    "3. **ReAct Prompting** - Thought → Action → Observation cycles\n",
    "4. **Feedback Loops** - Self-evaluation using tools in the ReAct loop to find mistakes and improve plans\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll simulate external API calls to gather weather data and activities. Then, process this information to create personalized travel itineraries based on interests and other constraints. Last, you'll implement a feedback loop to refine the plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a travel agent that can plan the perfect AgentsVille vacation!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps you'll follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define Vacation Details**\n",
    "    - Specify the trip duration, interests, and constraints.\n",
    "    - Use Pydantic to structure and verify this information in a class called `VacationInfo`.\n",
    "2. **Review Weather and Activity schedules**\n",
    "    - Simulate API calls to gather weather data and available activities in bulk\n",
    "    - Review the data manually to understand the available options\n",
    "3. **The ItineraryAgent**\n",
    "    - Implement an agent that generates a day-by-day itinerary based on the vacation details\n",
    "    - The system prompt will guide the agent's reasoning through a step-by-step planning process to take travel preferences (e.g. destination, dates, interests) and generate a detailed day-by-day itinerary\n",
    "    - Craft the components of the prompt (including the role, task/instructions, output format, examples, and context) to elicit the best possible itinerary in one LLM call\n",
    "4. **Evaluating the Itinerary**\n",
    "    - Evaluate the itinerary using a set of criteria to ensure a high-quality travel plan\n",
    "        - For instance, does the itinerary match the city and the dates requested?\n",
    "        - Or, is the total cost calulation accurate and is it within budget?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent hallucinate any activities that are not available?\n",
    "        - Or, does the agent suggest activities that are not suitable for the weather? This specific evaluation function will require the use of an LLM to compare the event description against the weather data.\n",
    "5. **Defining the Tools**\n",
    "    - We will define four tools to assist the agent\n",
    "        - **calculator_tool**: to accurately calculate costs\n",
    "        - **get_activities_by_date_tool**: to retrieve activities for a specific date\n",
    "        - **run_evals_tool**: to evaluate the itinerary against the criteria\n",
    "        - **final_answer_tool**: to provide the final answer in a structured format\n",
    "6. **The ItineraryRevisionAgent**\n",
    "    - We will implement a second agent that revises the itinerary based on feedback using the ReAct THOUGHT → ACTION → OBSERVATION cycle.\n",
    "        - The LLM will first generated a THOUGHT / ACTION message, which contains reasoning steps and a tool call invocation.\n",
    "        - The Python code will parse the tool call and execute it, returning the result as a string to the LLM in an OBSERVATION message.\n",
    "        - After this cycle repeats n number of times, the LLM will invoke the final_answer_tool to signal to the Python code to end the loop and return the final answer.\n",
    "    - This agent will also **incorporate feedback on the initial itinerary** from the travelers to ensure the final plan has **at least 2 activities per day**. A new evaluation function using a powerful LLM will be created to check this user feedback.\n",
    "    - The agent will use the tools above to refine the plan iteratively, checking the weather and available activities, and ensuring the itinerary meets all constraints.\n",
    "7. **Something just for fun!**\n",
    "    - To wrap things up we'll create a fun, narrative summary of the trip, highlighting the best activities and experiences!"

       "The trip to AgentsVille features two travelers, Yuri and Hiro. Yuri is 30 years old and has interests in tennis, cooking, comedy, and technology. Hiro is 25 and enjoys reading, music, theatre, and art. The trip spans from June 10 to June 12, 2025, with a total budget of 130 units and a planned total cost of 103 units, ensuring the activities are well within budget.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 10, the weather is clear and warm, making it a perfect day for outdoor activities. The day begins with \"Serve & Savor: Tennis and Taste Luncheon,\" a unique event combining tennis and cooking in a lively outdoor setting, ideal for Yuri’s passion for both tennis and cooking. Later in the evening, Hiro can enjoy the \"AgentsVille Twilight Writing Escape,\" an indoor event focused on writing and storytelling, providing a cozy and creative environment that aligns well with his interests in reading and art.\n",
       "\n",
       "On June 11, the temperature rises slightly with partly cloudy skies, suitable for a mix of indoor and outdoor experiences. During lunch, the \"Tech Lunch & Learn: AI Frontiers\" offers a dynamic indoor gathering that caters to Yuri’s enthusiasm for technology and Hiro’s appreciation for music, photography, and writing. In the afternoon, the \"AgentsVille Art & Music Fusion Fest\" takes place outdoors, merging live music and interactive art exhibits—perfect for Hiro's love of both art and music while taking advantage of the pleasant weather.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the final day, June 12, thunderstorms are expected, so the itinerary provides flexible options with indoor backups. The midday event, \"Soundtrack Picnic: Lunchtime Movies & Melodies,\" combines classic films with live music and includes a plan to move indoors if the weather turns bad. This suits both travelers, with Yuri’s interest in music and Hiro’s interest in movies. In the evening, \"Tech & Film Fusion Night\" at an indoor virtual reality theater offers an immersive blend of technology and cinema, appealing directly to Yuri’s love of technology and Hiro’s movie interest, wrapping up the trip with an engaging and futuristic experience.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, the itinerary thoughtfully balances interests, weather conditions, and timing to deliver a fulfilling and comfortable trip for both travelers."
